_My application development was generally successful. I'm very happy with the UI and how the user interface is consistent across the application._

_The main features from the requirements are there for the most part, they were hindered by some difficulty using the Google Maps API alongside the Formula One API. This meant I had to change my approach to a more rigid, less elegant solution where I hard coded the track location details._

_If I had more development time, I would change the main home page to open a full screen dialog with further information form the main article, this didn't happen in the development timeframe because the API didn't include the article content - I had planned to create my own web scraper but ran out of time._

_I'm also happy with how the application compares the current time to the Date object of race day, each week, and re-requests the API responses after race day, updating the content throughout the app. With more time I could make this live update, I would need to make use of a python module and host a server._
