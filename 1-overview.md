_This app was designed to give formula one fans a better experience than provided by the official app. The app will allow users to view upcoming races, see latest formula one news, view driver/constructor standings and view the current season's formula one tracks._

_The official formula one app allows you to view current standings and latest news but doesn't give users a good way to interact with races / other general information. Formula one enthusiasts want to be reminded of when F1 events start, something the current app doesn't do._

_I decided to make this app because I felt like the official app didnt meet my own requirements as an F1 enthusiast. I want to include features in my app which I wish were part of the official app. I think this app has the potential to be a better option than the official app due to the extra features and superior UI design._

_Usability and design is a big focus for me, I want to make sure the app is easily accessible, not overly complex and not bloated with useless information._
